Health Disorder Prediction,
In this, Ocular Disease Detection is performed.
Ocular Disease Intelligent Recognition (ODIR) is a structured ophthalmic database of 5,000 patients with age, color fundus photographs from left and right eyes and doctors' diagnostic keywords from doctors.
There are 8 cases:
* Normal (N),
* Diabetes (D),
* Glaucoma (G),
* Cataract (C),
* Age related Macular Degeneration (A),
* Hypertension (H),
* Pathological Myopia (M),
* Other diseases/abnormalities (O),
For dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/ocular-disease-recognition-odir5k ,
Efficientnetb1 architecture is used for this project for more accuracy. I also tried with VGG and Resnet50, but Efficientnetb1 was good.
